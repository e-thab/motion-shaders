Experiment w/ color
FPS controller
Partial screen effect
More complex objects
Different noise pattern

Look into: Shadow mapping

Look up: Optical illusions in games

object material textures, potential application for occlusion. use colors to encode during processing rather than edge detection shader

build project & share
