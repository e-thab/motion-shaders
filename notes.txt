Experiment w/ color
FPS controller
Partial screen effect
More complex objects
Different noise pattern
Generate new random color

Look into: Shadow mapping
https://github.com/capnramses/antons_opengl_tutorials_book/tree/master/38_texture_shadows

Look up: Optical illusions in games

object material textures, potential application for occlusion. use colors to encode during processing rather than edge detection shader

change color a little bit rather than flipping, start darkening on full white

look for cel shade shader / toon shader

Shaders:
    pov_incremental
        -best with linear noise
        -variable for increment amount (change speed)
    
    pov_fade
        -noise irrelevant
        -variables for color and fade speed
