Experiment w/ color
FPS controller
Partial screen effect
More complex objects
Different noise pattern
Generate new random color

Look into: Shadow mapping
https://github.com/capnramses/antons_opengl_tutorials_book/tree/master/38_texture_shadows

Look up: Optical illusions in games

object material textures, potential application for occlusion. use colors to encode during processing rather than edge detection shader

change color a little bit rather than flipping, start darkening on full white

look for cel shade shader / toon shader

Noise:
    Binary:
    	each pixel is either black or white
	Linear:
		each pixel has a random monochrome value (R=G=B)
	Full color:
		each pixel has a randomized color value
    Perlin:
    	perlin noise
	Fill white:
		all pixels are white

Shaders:
    Invert (pov.gshader): Any pixel that changed from black to some color this frame, invert 
    	-best with binary noise
	
    Binary: Original implementation. On c
        
	
    Incremental
        -best with linear noise
	-strange gray effect with binary noise
        -variable for increment amount (change speed)
    
    Fade:
        -noise irrelevant
        -variables for color, difference threshold, and fade speed

    Fade full color:
        -noise irrelevant
        -variables for difference threshold and fade speed
